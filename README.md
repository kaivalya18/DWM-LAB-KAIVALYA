Implemented different techniques for handling missing values, including mean/mode imputation, interpolation, and removal.

2️⃣ Data Flow Transformations in ETL ⚙️

Applied ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for data preprocessing.

Implemented filtering, aggregation, and schema mapping.

3️⃣ OLAP Operations on a Multi-Dimensional Data Cube 📊

Explored roll-up, drill-down, slice, and dice operations for analyzing multi-dimensional data.

4️⃣ Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Itemset Mining 🛒

Implemented the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets in transactional data.

Generated association rules using support and confidence thresholds.

5️⃣ Naïve Bayes Algorithm 🤖

Implemented the Naïve Bayes classifier for text classification and probabilistic prediction.

6️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm 📌

Developed a KNN classifier and evaluated its performance with different values of K.

7️⃣ K-Means Clustering Algorithm 🔍

Applied K-Means clustering for unsupervised learning.

Visualized cluster formation using data visualization techniques.

8️⃣ Decision Tree Algorithm 🌲

Built a decision tree model for classification.

Used information gain and entropy for rule-based learning.

9️⃣ Linear Regression 📈

Implemented linear regression to analyze relationships between variables.

Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² scores.
